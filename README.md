## This repository consists of one script called run_analysis which was created in R
## The script reads data from two datasets; a test and a train dataset, and merges them to create a dataset called 'altogether'
## The 'altogether' dataset is slimmed down to include only the means and the standard deviations of the variables (which are explained in the codebook). This dataset is called 'meanstd'
## A second dataset called 'avetable' calculates the means of all the variable by activity and by user
## Further and more specific variable information is available in the codebook
